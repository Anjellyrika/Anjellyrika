# 🌸 Hi, I'm Jelly!

💬 My name is Angelica. More commonly known as **Jelly** among my peers~

📚 I am currently a third-year BS in Computer Science student at the [University of the Philippines-Diliman](https://upd.edu.ph/).

✨ I’ve recently developed an interest in front-end web development and UI/UX, founded on my passion for the multimedia arts field—mainly digital illustration, graphic design, video editing and animation.

👀 Check out some of my [dev projects](https://github.com/Anjellyrika?tab=repositories) here on Github, or my [art](https://www.instagram.com/ajellyrawr/) on Instagram!
