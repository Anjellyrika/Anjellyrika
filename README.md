# ðŸŒ¸ Hi, I'm Jelly!

ðŸ’¬ My name is *Angelica*, more commonly known as **Jelly** among my peers.

ðŸ“š I graduated from the [University of the Philippines-Diliman](https://upd.edu.ph/) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, earning magna cum laude honors.

ðŸ”¨ Most of my experience has been in front-end web development and UI/UX design. I love creating interfaces that are both intuitive and visually appealing!

âœ¨ I have a passion for the arts, mainly digital illustration, graphic design, video editing and animation. I've also picked up a bit of game development and 3D modelling.
