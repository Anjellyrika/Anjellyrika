# ðŸŒ¸ Hi, I'm Jelly!

ðŸ’¬ My name is Angelica. More commonly known as **Jelly** among my peers~

ðŸ“š I am currently a third-year BS in Computer Science student at the [University of the Philippines-Diliman](https://upd.edu.ph/).

âœ¨ Iâ€™ve recently developed an interest in front-end web development and UI/UX, founded on my passion for the multimedia arts fieldâ€”mainly digital illustration, graphic design, video editing and animation.

ðŸ‘€ Check out some of my [dev projects](https://github.com/Anjellyrika?tab=repositories) here on Github, or my [art](https://www.instagram.com/ajellyrawr/) on Instagram!

ðŸ’Œ You can send me an e-mail at angelicaj.raborar@gmail.com

ðŸ’œ Thanks for stopping by!
